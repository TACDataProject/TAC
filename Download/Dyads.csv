The Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA) was one of three groups fighting for independence from Portugal in the 1960s, together with UNITA and FNLA.  In 1975 Portugal agreed to hand over control to a transitional power-sharing government between the three groups; this quickly fell apart.  The MPLA succeeded in establishing a marxist, Soviet- and Cuban-supported government and continued to fight UNITA, FNLA, and the Cabinda groups for decades.  The SideA in this conflict, Angola, is the MPLA-dominated government.",0,NA,,,,,,,

ADF, Allied Democratic Forces, was a rebel group fighting the western Ugandan government and had its root in evangelistic Muslim Tabliqi Jamaat movement of Uganda. The movement was unpopular in Uganda and was thus forced to recruit its fighters mainly in eastern DRC... What is clearis that the ADF rebellion became closely linked to the larger context of the conflict in neighbouring DRC."" Also, according to CGS: It is clear that the group (ADF) was considerably weaker than the Ugandan government, however, it was able to continue its activities due to support from Sudan and Zaire (including Zaire allowing ADF to set up bases outside on its territory) and due to the distance it was from the Ugandan government. This gives reason to believe that the relationship between Kata Katanga and ADF cannot be fully established. DRC government, according to CGS, supplies ADF with money, ADF recruits troops from Katanga, and Kata Katanga groups fight DRC government.",0,NA,,,,,,,
