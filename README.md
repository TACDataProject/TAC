# Terrorism in Armed Conflict

The Terrorism in Armed Conflict (TAC) project was developed to enable the study of terrorism within intrastate armed conflicts by uniting the most comprehensive available data sources from both research communities. TAC is led by Page Fortna (Columbia University) with Nick Lotito (Yale University) and Mike Rubin (UCSD).

TAC brings together information from the most commonly used data set in the study of civil war, the Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP) Dyadic Dataset and the most comprehensive event data set on terrorism, STARTâ€™s Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The data set is designed to capture as much information as possible, and then to provide flexibility to the researcher to handle the uncertainty regarding assigning group responsibility to incidents.

Currently, TAC provides annual counts of the use of terrorism by 409 armed opposition groups in 166 intrastate conflicts in 96 countries from 1970-2013.

# Code Repository

This repository includes the source data and code to generate the Terrorism in Armed Conflict data set.

The code is implemented in both Stata and R (see the `Stata` and `R` folders, respectively).
